Welcome to the Local-Wiki project! 

This is a community-driven platform dedicated to sharing information about fun and unique local places across the United States that are not widely known. Whether it's a hidden gem in a bustling city or a remote natural wonder, we believe that every place has something special to offer and deserves to be discovered.

Here is the deployed website :
